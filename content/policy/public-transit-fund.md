## Summary

With a land value tax of 0.5% Portland can nearly double it's funding of GP metro. This can be used to dramatically increase routes and frequency.

## The History

In 1916 electric streetcars crisscrossed Portland and it's surrounding Cities. Fairs were as low as 5 cents and trollies ran as often as every ten minutes. Electricity was invented within living memory, we had less technology, we had roughly the same population and yet we had an electric trolley network that would put a modern North American City to shame. We can afford good transit. Take a look at this modern style map reconstructed by a Wikipedia Editor:

## The Plan

It will take us quite some time to catch up to where we were in 1916, but we can take steps to get there. One way to do that is induced demand. When a mode of transit becomes better it induces demand to fill up that mode of transit. This is why making roads wider is often ineffective. Wider roads cause more people to drive, filling up the roads. With roads the more people who use them the worse. With transit the more people who use it the better. The more money there will be to make the system run more frequently and on more routes. Public transit is also far more efficient and environmentally friendly than cars so inducing demand for it will have lots of benefits. We need to make public transit a desirable alternative to cars so people will get used to using it and in the future we can expand it even further.

Public transit increases the value of surrounding properties. Being near a bus or train station is an advantage that makes real estate more valuable. Developers and land owners profit off of this increase. By levying a land value tax the city can also profit off of the improvements they make to land values. In this way building public transit can help to raise revenue for the city or at least be revenue neutral.
