## Summary

The Monument Square Superblock will pedestrianize our historic Monument Square while closing one block of congress street to car traffic, creating bus and bike only lanes to make our bus service more efficient. Access to Parking Garages will be maintained and there will still be nearby vehicle access to the existing businesses.

- Close Congress Street between Center Street and Elm Street to Car Traffic, repurpose the street to make two bus lanes and two cycling lanes to prevent through traffic and make transit and cycling faster
- Close Federal Street from Congress Street to Temple Street to vehicle traffic to pedestrianize Monument Square
- Close Free Street to car traffic from the entrance of the One City Center Parking Garage to Temple Street to pedestrianize Monument Square
- Make the segment of Free Street from Center Street to the entrance of the One City Center Parking Garage two way, removing some street parking to maintain access to the garage and parking lot on the opposite side of the street
- Close a small segment of Preble Street from the entrance to the Public Library to Congress Street to vehicle traffic to prevent vehicles from getting stuck

## Rollout Plan

This entire plan can be accomplished with just some paint, signs, and cones. There is no need for expensive projects with concrete and asphalt. There is no need for long construction or analysis and planning periods. We can start temporary, see how it goes, and reverse course if it doesn't work out.

### Phase One: The Super Block Party

For phase one Livable Portland can set up temporary structures. We can cover signs with black plastic bags, put up new temporary signs, paint streets with temporary paint, and put up cones or plants to block off streets. This is called tactical urbanism, small temporary changes to see what works. We hope to leave this up for one month and have events in Monument Square to help show the public what the plans could be like. Local businesses could set up in Monument Square, as they already sometimes do and we can plan demonstrations and talks of some of the benefits of the project. In the meantime we will also be observing the effects on traffic, local businesses, transit, cycling, and pedestrians.

Real life experiments are usually better than performing studies to predict the effects of a project. Not only are studies very expensive and time consuming but the effects of a project are often very difficult to predict in advance giving you a false sense of confidence before you jump into a project. By doing it this way it can be both cheap and more transparent to the public. The public will get to see and experience the project in real life.

### Phase Two: Semi Permanent

If phase one goes well we can commit to making the change semi-permanent. Getting some proper signs, replacing cones with concrete, and some higher quality paint. All very cheap and all still reversible if things go wrong. We can remain in this phase for as long as we want without worrying about temporary structures fading or toppling over.

### Phase Three: Beautification

Phase three can last forever. Once we have a shared space we may want to make it more beautiful and more permanent over time. If we have some money to replace concrete partitions with some nice bollards or planters we can do that, if we want nicer street signs we can do that, if we want to re-surface streets that are now pedestrian only we can do that. All of these investments will be made on a case by case basis as the budget allows and slowly over time. This will allow the space to grow organically, becoming better and better without spending all of our money on a giant project that could go wrong.

## Benefits

### Transit

One of biggest downsides to busses as a mode of transit is that they get stuck in traffic behind cars. This means that on top of needing to stick to a schedule a bus will be just as slow, if not slower than driving. Mass transit is carries way more people than its equivalent size in cars so if they were allowed some priority the amount of time people spent traveling would be cut way down. Better yet, if the bus ride was faster and more attractive, more people would take the bus, reducing traffic further and justifying more bus frequency, which can attract even more bus riders. It's a virtuous cycle.

So how can we give transit a bit of priority? A lot of cities have metros or subways with trains running on their own separated tracks or underground. Portland itself used to have an extensive electric streetcar network. This works great, but unfortunately right now it is too expensive to build a whole rail network. Cities can simulate some of these effects on a budget by creating designated bus lanes. Designated bus lanes are lanes for buses only, ensuring that buses don't get stuck in traffic. To make our service more efficient we need to move towards designated bus lanes.

The Monument Square Superblock is the single smallest step we can make right now towards giving buses priority. Every Portland Bus route and many South Portland Bus Routes run through the section of Congress Street in front of Monument Square. That is over 12 routes, all on this one segment!

To make matters worse this segment has some of the worst traffic in the whole city:

This tiny block is a bottleneck for bus services that run all over the city and beyond. This area is the highest value we could possibly get for giving buses priority and we would only need to give up one block. By closing this block, cars will be discouraged from using Congress Street to travel on the peninsula without any businesses losing their car access. If you want to go to a congress street business by car you still can, it just won't make as much sense to go somewhere else using Congress Street. This should reduce traffic not just on this block but on many of the surrounding blocks of congress street, giving buses an express route and even making driving to places on Congress Street more pleasant.

### Cycling

Since the segment of Congress Street that will be closed to cars is three lanes there will be more than enough space for two cycling lanes in either direction. This will have similar benefits to the bus only lanes, making cycling an even more efficient option than driving.

### Driving

I know this will seem hypocritical but I do drive, and I drive on Congress Street sometimes and it is not pleasant. There is a lot of traffic. Congress Street has a lot of businesses on it but it is also a wide central street people use for traveling. If you are actually on Congress Street you are waiting in traffic behind all of these people. By making this small change, you may be re-routed when driving further away but if you are driving to Congress Street you will actually have less traffic.
