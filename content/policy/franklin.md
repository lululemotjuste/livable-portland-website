## The History

<p class="text-center"><img src="/MiddleFranklin1969_web.jpg" alt="Destruction"/></p>

In the 1960s, hundreds people, most of whom low income earners, were forced from their homes and businesses. These homes and businesses were seized and demolished to make room for a new wide road to serve a new bridge from Portland to South Portland. That bridge was never built and today we have Franklin Street; a wide road to nowhere cutting across out city where there was once a thriving community.

Franklin Street is hostile to pedestrians, bikers, and public transit. Most of it has no sidewalk so there is nowhere to walk or wait for public transit. There are also no bike lanes. The road is extremely wide and the lights are timed so it is very hard to walk across, and more often than not you will need to wait for two full light cycles just to cross. Due to the small amount of crossings people need to walk far out of their way to get across.

Recognizing that this road was not serving our community, plans were made in 2015 to improve Franklin Street. It is now seven years later and we are no closer to fixing it. The plans have an estimated cost of $26,334,360 (roughly $30,976,985.77 in today's money) and we are waiting to have the funds available. Our city has a lot of important budget priorities, the time may never come when we can just spend 31 Million Dollars (or more by the time it gets spent) on this project. And once it's done the more complex infrastructure will require even more ongoing maintenance cost.

But there is another way. All of the money we need to fund this project, and then some, is right there under the road itself: the land. You don't need me to tell you that land in this city has gotten a lot more expensive. Since the city used eminent domain to purchase the land it's value has gone up dramatically. It has gone up so much, in fact, that we can afford to fix the mistakes of the past and have money left to spare.

## The Plan

We can improve this community, and pay for it too, by eliminating two of the lanes and the median of the road: selling some of this land for the development of market rate housing and using the rest for affordable housing and park space. Not only will this raise more than enough revenue to cover the cost of modifying the road, the increased tax base will increase overall city revenue permanently.

## Benefits

### Affordable Housing

- First Affordable Plot: 52,043 ft²
- Second Affordable Plot: 38,556 ft²
- Total: 90,599 ft²
- Units per 1000 ft²: 2.64
- **Projected Affordable Units: 238**

**Based on Solterra affordable housing project which has [55 units](https://bangordailynews.com/2020/11/18/bdn-maine/portland-housing-authority-announces-completion-of-solterra-at-58-boyd-street/) on a [20,862 ft² parcel](https://portlandme.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=6208128831ea40c7a7c432317527336b). An affordable housing project adjacent to the proposed ones built within the last few years.*

This plan will add two new land parcels for affordable housing, that can be subdivided further, separated by a small park with a walking and cycling path. These affordable housing lots are situated in an area surrounded by other successful affordable housing projects. This new land can help build on this past success. It will also improve the surrounding affordable housing projects by providing easier access to green space, and easier walking access to the shops on the other side of Franklin Street.

### More Usable Green Space

- **54,687 ft² of new accessible green space**
- **2 green space areas**

Franklin Street currently has a median with grass, but this is not green space. Nobody is spending time walking on this grass because it is wedged between a major road. It is both unpleasant and inaccessible.

What is green space is Lincoln Park, which was cut down in size by Franklin Street's expansion. With this plan we can restore Lincoln Park, our city's oldest public park to it's former glory, and even add a little extra. Lincoln Park is also a bit underutilized right now because it is not near much housing, relatively small, and near major roads. Adding more housing and calming nearby roads will also help unlock the potential of this green space that we already have.

In addition to expanding our oldest park we can get a new park. This new park will be usable green space between affordable housing parcels, can have some recreational facilities, complements the existing green space on the other side of Franklin Street, and provides a new pedestrian and cycling path to make the other side of Franklin Street more accessible.

### Walkability

- **4 new pedestrian and cycling paths**
- **5 improved intersections**
- **New sidewalks along the whole street**

This plan adds walking and biking paths across Franklin street at every intersection so pedestrians and cyclists don't need to walk all the way around just to cross. All existing intersections will be improved by the narrowing of the road, so pedestrians won't need to wait two light cycles to cross. Slower speeds will also keep the road safer for both pedestrians and cyclists. Sidewalks in front of the new developments will give pedestrians more space to walk.

### Revenue Positive

- First Market Plot: 15,611 ft²
- Second Market Plot: 30,693 ft²
- Third Market Plot: 53,485 ft²
- Total: 99,789 ft²
- Land Sale Cost per ft²: $52.13
- Land Sale Cost: $5,202,452.26
- Existing Franklin Street Plan Cost: $30,976,985.77
- Deficit: $25,774,533.50
- Annual Property Tax Revenue per ft²: $18.63
- Annual Property Tax Revenue: $18.63
- Annual Property Tax Revenue: $1,859,121.24
- Annual Payments on a 30 year Municipal Bond at 2.07% Interest: $1,162,000
- **Net Gain in Tax Revenue First 30 Years: $697,121.24**
- **Upfront Costs: $0**

**Based on 99 Federal Street project. [Info from tax record property search](https://assessors.portlandmaine.gov/Search/commonsearch.aspx?mode=realprop). Search for 56 Hampshire St, the address before it was 99 Federal St. A private development adjacent to the proposed developments built within the last few years.*

Even using modest estimates and not factoring in property value increases this project will more than pay for itself. Selling the land will fund a significant chunk of the project and the increased tax revenue from the new properties will fund the rest. By issuing municipal bonds we can tap that future revenue to avoid needing to raise any taxes up front for the project. The increase in revenue will pay off the loan and still leave money left to spare.

## Addressing Concerns

### Won't adding new luxury developments make gentrification worse?

On it's own maybe, but this project will add more affordable units than market rate units. The new market-rate developments are concentrated to a neighborhood that already has a lot of market-rate development and high housing costs.

### Won't this make traffic worse?

I am not going to sugarcoat it, this may make drivers go a little slower along Franklin Street. I believe the many benefits of this proposal are a lot to sacrifice on the altar of driving a little faster. The entire stretch of Franklin Street effected by this plan is just under 3/4 of a mile. How much time do drivers truly save going just a bit faster over such a tiny distance? Even if the average driving speed down Franklin Street was just 10 miles per hour it would still take you under 4 and a half minutes to drive the whole stretch, and 10 miles per hour is quite an extreme estimate. The average travel speed by car in Manhattan South of 60th Street was [7.2 miles per hour in 2016](https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/mobility-report-2018-screen-optimized.pdf). Adding some intersections and narrowing one street making it like nearly every other street is in this city is not going to make congestion as bad as Manhattan and even if it did it would add just minutes of travel time by car.

### Isn't financing with debt irresponsible?

Debt can be a bad thing if taken on irresponsibly. However, debt can actually be a good thing. The debt taken on by this project is responsible debt because the debt is being used to pay for something that will demonstrably increase revenue so we can pay for that debt and have even more revenue left to spare. In the end we will end up with more money than if we had never taken the debt on because if we had simply saved money until we could afford the project, we would miss out on all of that revenue we could have been getting right away if we had taken on debt up front. Also, municipal debt right now is quite cheap while interest rates are low. It is possible that increases in property values and inflation will outpace the municipal debt interest.
