## Summary

This upzoning proposal is a series of incremental changes in the zoning code to allow areas to modestly increase their density and diversify their land uses. These numbers change legal minimums, maximums, and usages to give people more options than they had before. We are mandating that anyone do anything to their property we are just giving people more options with their own land. Don't know what some of these zones mean or where they are? Check out [zoning 101](/zoning)!

- Upgrade all existing R-5 Zoned areas to R-6. Most significant effects:
    - Decrease minimum residential lot sizes from 6,000 ft² to 2,000 ft²
    - Decrease lot area per dwelling unit from 3,000 ft² to 725 ft²
    - Increase maximum lot coverage from 40% to 60%
- Upgrade all existing R-1, R-2, and R-3 Zones to R-5 Zones. Most significant effects:
    - Make multi-family dwellings legal in these places
    - Decrease minimum residential lot sizes from 15,000 ft², 10,000 ft², and 6,500 ft² to 6,000 ft²
    - Decrease lot area per dwelling unit from 15,000 ft², 10,000 ft², and 6,500 ft² to 3,000 ft²
    - Increase maximum lot coverage from 20%, 20%, and 35% to 40%
- Eliminate minimum parking requirements
- Apply the B-1b (Neighborhood Business) approved land uses as a minimum to all zones in the city:
    - Single-family dwellings
    - Two-family dwellings
    - Multi-family dwellings
    - Combined living/working spaces
    - Lodging houses (ground floor only)
    - Clinics (ground floor only)
    - Elementary, middle, and secondary schools (ground floor only)
    - Governmental uses (ground floor only)
    - Places of assembly (< 10,100 ft²) (ground floor only)
    - Preschool facilities (ground floor only)
    - Bed and breakfasts (this means official bed and breakfasts not AirBnB which already exists in every zone)
    - General offices (< 5,000 ft²) (ground floor only)
    - General Services (< 5,000 ft²) (ground floor only)
    - Hostels
    - Restaurants (ground floor only)
    - Retail (< 5,000 ft²) (ground floor only)
    - Studios for artists and craftspeople (ground floor only)
    - Parks and open spaces
    - Solar energy system (minor)
    - Utility substations

## Why increase density?

Portland needs more housing, a lot more housing, but it is effectively illegal to build more housing in nearly 75% of the city's land area. Do you notice how construction projects from luxury condos to buildings filled with affordable housing tend to be constructed on the peninsula? This is not just because people like to live there, it's because it is pretty much the only place where new housing developments are legally allowed. Instead of a natural gradient of density increasing as it gets closer to the peninsula, the peninsula is becoming denser and denser while off the peninsula is dominated mostly by single family homes.

This effect is squeezing out middle density homes like townhomes or duplexes which also squeezes out the middle class homes until the only projects that make sense to build are high-end condos for the wealthy and subsidized government-built dense housing for the very poor. If we allow the construction in our city to become increasingly unequal then inevitably, the wealth of it's citizens will become increasingly unequal.

Upzoning will create a natural density gradient, preventing a scenario of massive density on the peninsula and almost no density off of it. R-5 zones are in areas well served by public transit and are relatively close to the peninsula. This makes them a good candidate for increasing density without increasing car traffic as much. Zones R-1, R-2, and R-3 will be allowed to grow but still maintain lower densities as they are a bit further out and more car-dependent.

This upzoning proposal aims to target the middle, allowing areas that make sense to build middle density housing. This is not going to turn the whole city into Downtown Manhattan. If you are worried about the fate of R-1, R-2, and R-3 zones, take a walk in one of our R-5 zones. It is still mostly single family homes, it is just moderately denser. That is what we are talking about here. If you are worried about the fate of our R-5 zones take a walk in one of our R-6 neighborhoods. These overwhelmingly lovely neighborhoods with middle density housing. In fact they are some of the most desirable neighborhoods in the city.

## Why add more land uses?

This proposal also takes what's allowed in the most restricted type of mixed used zone in the city (Neighborhood Business B) and allows it everywhere. This is the smallest change towards mixed use zoning. Only the smallest offices, retail, and restaurants will be allowed and only on the ground floor. It continues to forbid disruptive uses like Bars, Marijuana Stores, any sort of industrial use, parking lots, and more.

These changes in land use will make for more walkable neighborhoods and will favor the creation of small businesses run by members of our community. Personally, I love small neighborhood businesses. They give a neighborhood character and I love Portland's many existing B-1b zones. Because only small businesses can open in the space it creates a niche for local businesses to fill, giving them a little leg up in convenience. But there are reasons aside from charm to like mixed use zoning.

Increasing density can increase travel times if we are not careful. We don't want to put a bunch of new cars on the road. We will want to increase public transit routes and frequency to help mitigate this but another critical way we can reduce traffic is with mixed use zoning like this.

On a typical day most people sleep in their home, go to work, and maybe go buy something, go to a park, a restaurant, a bowling alley, or a movie theater. You will need to travel between different kinds of places a lot and Mixed use zoning is great because you won't need to spend a lot of time doing it. If people spent a solid week at work, two straight days at restaurants, then a week sleeping Single Use Zoning may be an efficient option. 

Mixed use zoning cuts down travel time a lot for a few reasons. The most basic one is that you are more likely to be close to a place if it isn't illegal for certain types of places to be built close to where you live. Take a look at these two towns. The one on the left has a single commercial district in the bottom left. The town on the right has mixed use zoning with commercial buildings in red mixed in with residential buildings. The same trips are way shorter in the town with mixed-use zoning.

But wait, you might say. I don't live close to where I work so mixed use zoning won't help me. But Mixed use zoning can cut down your travel times too. Now that average trip distance is cut down a bit there will be fewer people traveling during rush hour so there will be less traffic and crowding. You can benefit indirectly from the effects of mixed use zoning, even if you travel long distances sometimes.

Just like mixed use zoning can help everyone, a lack of mixed use zoning hurts everyone. Everyone needing to drive everywhere will make traffic worse and travel times longer. Since everyone will have a car they will need somewhere to put it on both ends of their journey. This increases the amount of parking required.

These effects can create a vicious cycle. The more need for parking there is the bigger parking lots have to be which spaces stores even further from each other and makes them even less pleasant to be around. The need for large parking lots within commercial districts decreases the amount of available land there. Take a look at the B-7 commercial district in the Bayside Neighborhood:

<p class="text-center"><img src="/parking-land-new.png" alt="Parking Land Use"/></p>

Parking takes up a massive amount of the entire zone, and this is without highlighting the other land use for car infrastructure for 295 and it's ramps. The more single-use zoning we have the more separating uses and adding parking becomes necessary.

We need to start stepping down from the cycle of more parking and wider roads. This upzoning proposal is small, it won't change things overnight but it takes us one step away from this cycle. This should, over time, have exponential effects, decreasing traffic, and bringing us all a little closer together.
