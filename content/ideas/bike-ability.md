description: "Middle density housing is any housing that isn't a high rise appartment building or single family home on it's own lot. Most types of housing are middle density though looking around North America it might not feel that way. Middle density housing is often called \"missing middle housing\" but we don't call it that because here in Portland it isn't missing at all. Our city has a long and proud history of beautiful middle density housing. We want to protect the middle density housing that is already there and build even more of it!"
