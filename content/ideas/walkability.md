title: Walkability
description: "Walking the best form of transport we have. It is cheap, environmentally friendly, safe, and doesn't require much infrastructure. Unfortunately, it is not always so easy to walk to where you want to go. Certain communities are more "walkable" than others. There are two simple ingredients to walkability: walking needs to be a pleasant safe experience and there needs to places to walk to."
