title: Mixed Use Zoning
description: "Mixed use zoning makes for walkable neighborhoods, favors local businesses over large chains, fosters a sense of community, and can even help provide more revenue for the city. Most zoning in North America separates residential from commercial uses. This virtually guarantees that most places you go  will be far away because it keeps businesses away from homes."

Mixed use zoning means allowing different uses like housing, shops, offices, and restaurants to all be next to each other. It is the opposite of Single Use Zoning. Despite what it may seem in the United States, mixed use zoning has been and continues to be the norm for most of the world for most of history. Mixed use zoning doesn't mean people have to put different types of buildings near each other, it just means that they are not legally prevented from doing it if they want to.

On a typical day most people sleep in their home, go to work, and maybe go buy something, go to a park, a restaurant, a bowling alley, or a movie theater. You will need to travel between different kinds of places a lot and Mixed use zoning is great because you won't need to spend a lot of time doing it. If people spent a solid week at work, two straight days at restaurants, then a week sleeping Single Use Zoning may be an efficient option. 

Mixed use zoning cuts down travel time a lot for a few reasons. The most basic one is that you are more likely to be close to a place if it isn't illegal for certain types of places to be built close to where you live. Take a look at these two towns. The one on the left has a single commercial district in the bottom left. The town on the right has mixed use zoning with commercial buildings in red mixed in with residential buildings. The same trips are way shorter in the town with mixed-use zoning.

But wait, you might say. I don't live close to where I work so mixed use zoning won't help me but Mixed use zoning can cut down your travel times too. Now that average trip distance is cut down a bit there will be fewer people traveling during rush hour so there will be less traffic and crowding. You can benefit indirectly from the effects of mixed use zoning, even if you travel long distances sometimes.

These effects can create a vicious cycle. The more need for parking there is the bigger parking lots have to be which spaces stores even further from each other and makes them even less pleasant to be around. The need for large parking lots within commercial districts decreases the amount of available land there. Take a look at the B-7 commercial district in the bayside neighborhood:

Parking takes up a massive amount of the entire zone, and this is without highlighting the other land use for car infrastructure for 295 and it's ramps.
