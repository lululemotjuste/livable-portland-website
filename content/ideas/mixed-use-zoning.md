title: Mixed Use Zoning
description: "Mixed use zoning makes for walkable neighborhoods, favors local businesses over large chains, fosters a sense of community, and can even help provide more revenue for the city. Most zoning in North America separates residential from commercial uses. This virtually guaruntees that most places you go  will be far away because it keeps businesses away from homes. This means that you can't really walk anywhere because anywhere you might want to walk to is too far away which puts more people on the road in cars for longer which increases traffic and increases the need for parking."

Take a look at these two towns. The one on the left has a single commercial district in the bottom left. The town on the right has mixed use zoning with commercial buildings in red mixed in with residential buildings. The same trips are way shorter in the town with mixed-use zoning.

These effects can create a vicious cycle. The more need for parking there is the bigger parking lots have to be which spaces stores even further from each other and makes them even less pleasant to be around. The need for large parking lots within commercial districts decreases the amount of available land there. Take a look at the B-7 commercial district in the bayside neighborhood:

Parking takes up a massive amount of the entire zone, and this is without highlighting the other land use for car infrastructure for 295 and it's ramps.
