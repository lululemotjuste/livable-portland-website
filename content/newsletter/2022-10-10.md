### Media

- [A Voterâ€™s Guide to the Charter Commission Reforms 2022](http://thetownsman.org/charter-reforms-preface/): A bit off topic for this group but it is a comprehensive and well-balanced guide to the upcoming charter commission ballot questions.
- [Street Design Manual for Oslo](https://www.oslo.kommune.no/getfile.php/13441080-1646147194/Tjenester%20og%20tilbud/Plan%2C%20bygg%20og%20eiendom/Byggesaksveiledere%2C%20normer%20og%20skjemaer/Gatenormal%20og%20normark/Gate-%20og%20veinormaler/Street-design-manual_ENG.pdf): Oslo is a city with innovative street design and they also happen to get a lot of cold weather and snow like we do. The guide is highly detailed with a lot of good human-centric street design ideas we could implement here in Portland. 
- [NYC Proposal Offers Cash for Spotting Parking Violations in Bike Lanes](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-29/nyc-may-pay-people-for-reporting-bike-lane-blockers): An article from Bloomberg's CityLab discussing a proposal in New York City to allow citizens to report vehicles obstructing cycling lanes.
- [How Toronto Got Addicted to Cars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkO-DttA9ew): New Not Just Bikes video on the history of Toronto's car dependency
- [Plans for new upscale hotel next to Portland City Hall and Merrill Auditorium introduced](https://www.pressherald.com/2022/10/06/plans-for-new-upscale-hotel-next-to-portland-city-hall-and-merrill-auditorium-introduced/): A Portland Press Herald Article on the "Herald Square Development" on Congress Street by city hall. The developer will bring plans for the first phase, a 156 room hotel and nine condominiums in front of the Planning Board on October 25th. This is the first of several phases that will eventually include 297 total condominiums, seven retail spaces, a restaurant, recreation space, and 330 parking spaces.

    Context: This news is not a major surprise, the project has been in the works for a long time and the plans have gone through many revisions. Originally in 2020 the plan was a smaller hotel 147 rooms, more residential units (436), some of which would be senior living, as well as 495 parking spaces. Things seem further along now so this will most likely be closer to what the final project will look like.

This is in line with our state's new recent housing law [LD2003](https://legislature.maine.gov/LawMakerWeb/summary.asp?ID=280082953).

    Editorial: This is an exciting step for South Portland and hopefully will help develop some of the housing that the region needs.
