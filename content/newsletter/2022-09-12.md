description: The Planning Board will be reviewing the technical manual and we have an upcoming Livable Portland Meeting
date: 2022-09-12

Apologies again for how inconsistent this newsletter has been but there is some exciting stuff coming up soon. The biggest event these next two weeks is the Planning Board discussing amending the technical manual. The technical manual sets the design standards for a lot of our critical city infrastructure like streets and transportation systems. Going to the meeting this week will be a great chance to learn about the new changes. We are also looking to make our activity a bit more regular. We have been arranging some more social events in the discord server and some new members have joined but I haven't arranged a formal meeting in some time. Based on the weekday availability of the most recent survey I scheduled a meeting for next Tuesday and I hope to schedule them more regularly going forward. Hope to see you there and if you can't make it let me know and I can move the time around.

    - Discussion on amending the technical manual. The technical manual contains standards related to designing transportation systems, streets, sewers, storm drains, landscaping, street lighting, and more.
    - Workshop discussing a conditional use for 343 Cumberland Avenue for an emergency shelter by Prebble Street. Prebble Street needs to apply for a conditional use permit from the planning board because the current B-3 zone does not allow this use on it's own. Here is a link to the plan: https://css.portlandmaine.gov/
    - Report of a decision made at the meeting held on August 9th 2022: Master Development and Traffic Movement permit for 385 Congress Street. The council previously voted to modify some of the technical manual for the parking requirements of the building.
    - Map amendment for 50 county way. The council will consider rezoning the I-L (Low-Impact Industrial) to B-2 (Community Business) to allow Governmental Use as a Permitted Use. Project plan can be found here: https://css.portlandmaine.gov/
