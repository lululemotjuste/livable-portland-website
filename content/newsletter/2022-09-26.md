## Livable Portland Updates

Happy <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold">F</span><span style="color:orange; font-weight: bold">a</span><span style="color:yellow; font-weight: bold">l</span><span style="color:brown; font-weight: bold">l</span>! We are getting back into the swing of regular meetings. I am scheduling the next one for [Thursday, October 6th at 8 PM](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=NGtvYmhuNzZnamk0NThzaWF2aDFqODNjNmIgMXFpaWRqbW5ycmw4ZDdmOGh0c2FjdmxvbTBAZw&tmsrc=1qiidjmnrrl8d7f8htsacvlom0%40group.calendar.google.com). Every two weeks may be too frequent but the idea is both are on different days so everyone can come to at least one. There is no need to come to a meeting to get involved. Everything official we discuss will be shared in the Discord and in this Newsletter so please weigh in if you have thoughts and can't make a meeting. We discussed and agreed on a few potential official stances in the last meeting. I will share them here and in the Discord and we can discuss them once more in the next meeting to make sure everyone has had a chance to weigh in!

### Official Business

- We are working on refining our proposals from the [Re-Code wish list](https://trello.com/invite/b/yXKBu2SO/3fe9f5cd2e78f00f8d2ae218cfad6af6/re-code-wish-list) into a cohesive document. The document can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TLdpiSIZgkMp6rQS8LueeX8Uy-C0u-nKlHPUL-NCz4g/edit?usp=sharing). The Re-Code team is working on amendments so now is the time to get our recommendations together.
- In the meeting we expressed support to officially endorse [Nathaniel Ferguson](https://www.nathanielforportland.me/issues) in his campaign for District 3. Nathaniel is running on a platform of zoning reform and transit that is totally in line with our goals.
- In the meeting we expressed support to partner with the [Franklin Reclamation Authority](https://www.facebook.com/FranklinReclamationAuthority/) to advocate for prioritizing the Franklin Street Master Plan. While we would like to see some improvements to the plan, there will be space for those discussions and the existing plan is the best way we can move forward re-doing Franklin Street in the near term.

## The Next Two Weeks

    Editorial: Parking difficulties like this are inevitable when we design our city, and it's surrounding suburbs around the car. Downtown Portland is around 20% parking already, we will never build enough to keep up with the demand for parking cars require. Hopefully, we can work towards solutions to get people from place to place without devoting so much of our land to parking.
