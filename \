    <title>Livable Portland - Zoning 101</title>

<h1 class="text-primary">Zoning 101</h1>

<p>If you want an even-handed summary of zoning law you should look elsewhere. It is impossible to be truly unbiased so the best I can do is be as upfront as possible with my bias: I don't really think there should be zoning. I won't lie to you, I will cite my sources, and give you places to learn more but to me all of this information paints the picture that zoning is ultimately a bad thing and I hope to bring you to my position.</p>

<p>Zoning is a set of policies that govern how land can be used. Some common zoning policies are: the creation of residential zones (areas where businesses are't allowed), minimum parking requirements (certain types of buildings must have a minimum amount of off-street parking), and minimum lot size requirements (it is illegal for you to cut your property in half and sell half of it). Zoning policy can actually get pretty confusing, not just because the zoning codes are hundreds of pages long, but because what is and isn't zoning is actually pretty arbitrary. Houston Texas has "no zoning code" but they have a lot of the same kinds of laws that would be in a zoning code they just call them something else. Building height is usually considered zoning but in New York City they use a system of Air Rights for that. Even though there are lots of weird exceptions like that the zoning codes of American Cities mostly look pretty similar.</p>
