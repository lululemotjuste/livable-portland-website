    purposeStatement: To protect the character of existing developed residential neighborhoods
      on the islands and to allow infill where there are adequate public services.
      Expansion or extension of an existing IR-2 zone should be strictly limited,
      generally focused toward areas adjacent to existing village IR-2 areas, and
      restricted by such factors as adequacy of access, whether adequate water will
      be available for private use and for fire protection, and whether soils in the
      area are adequate for subsurface water disposal or whether public sewers are
      available. IR-2 rezoning on substantially sized parcels should not be considered

The following guidelines shall be considered, among others, in establishing an IR-3 zone:
      <ol type="A">
      <li>An IR-3 zone should have a minimum land area of 20 acres.</li>
      <li>A site for an IR-3 zone should be able to accommodate higher density development by providing buffers from surrounding areas on a substantially-sized parcel for which natural amenities are capable of being conserved in a development plan for the site.</li>
      <li>IR-3 zones should not be established unless issues of municipal services, including infrastructure, education, and police and fire services and other municipal services can be appropriately and adequately addressed.</li>
      <li>The differences in scale and intensity of uses between existing development and the IR-3 zone, and the cumulative impact on the overall density of the island, should be mitigated by appropriate open space and buffer areas.</li>
      <li>The development plan should have the capability of meeting the development review standards of the zone.</li>

      in to purchase goods and services. Buildings and uses shall be designed with
      attractive storefronts or similar features, with windows and doors convenient
      to a public sidewalk. This zone encourages mixed-use buildings, such as commercial

      mixed-use buildings with residential uses above ground floor commercial space
      and on the ground floor where the principal street frontage is maintained for
      active commercial uses. The zone also provides the opportunity for mixed use
      and high residential density. Suitable locations for this zone may include street

      by automobile, by pedestrians and by bicycle. Development in the B-2 zone should
      relate to the surrounding neighborhoods by design, orientation, and circulation
      patterns. The zone should provide locations for moderate to high-density housing
      in urban neighborhoods along arterials.
  - code: B-2b

      which exhibits a pedestrian scale and character. Such locations may include
      the peninsula and other arterials and intersections with an existing urban or
      neighborhood- oriented building pattern. The B-2b should provide locations for
      moderate to high-density housing in urban neighborhoods along arterials.

      the low-intensity nature of the uses, as well as their strict performance standards,
      will ensure the compatibility of the uses with other adjacent industrial and

      are located on arterials or collectors. The I-Mb zone is similarly located on
      the peninsula. These locations provide for direct access onto arterials, thereby
      protecting residential neighborhoods from drive-through traffic. The purpose
      of the I-M, I-Ma and I-Mb industrial zones is also to provide for larger industrial
      buildings and for the limited or controlled use of areas outside of structures
      for storage of materials and machinery. These facilities often require large
      volumes of imported materials and products which result in large volumes of
      shipping and receiving. Often uses may be highway-oriented and transportation-related,
      thus relying on citywide and regional transportation infrastructure. Industrial
      uses in these moderate-impact industrial zones may require separation from higher-impact

      of demonstrating, through design, layout and topography, their compatibility
      with, or non- intrusion on, existing or future higher impact industrial uses
      on adjacent or neighboring I-H zoned properties. Due to the intensity of use,
      the I-H zones are intended for uses which may require extensive outdoor storage
      and usage and may utilize heavy equipment. Processes may require separation
      from residential or sensitive environmental areas. The I-H zones are separated
      from other nonindustrial uses as well as natural or constructed features. High-impact
      industrial uses will be of a higher intensity, with a greater lot coverage,
      than the other zones.
